# IM-TQA: A Chinese Table Question Answering Dataset with Implicit and Multi-type Table Structures
IM-TQA is a chinese table question answering dataset with **1,200 tables** and **5,000 question-answer pairs**, which highlights **I**mplicit and **M**ulti-type table structures for the real-world **TQA** scenario. **It yields a more challenging table QA setting where the model needs to handle different types of tables and header cell annotations are also not provided in advance.** By contrast, previous TQA benchmarks mainly focus on limited table types with explicit table structures (i.e., the model knows exactly which cells are headers). We collect multi-type tables and ask professional annotators to annotate header cell locations, natural language look-up questions together with their answer cell locations. More details, analyses, and baseline results can be found in the [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.278/).
